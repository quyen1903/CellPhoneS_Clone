This project created base on someone project on the internet :v
(we can use cmd or powershell but i suggest to use gitbash)


First inside server folder we type command
npm run start


then open another git process on client folder(do not cd because it can interrupt our server)
and use this command
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider


in cse we use gitbash(as I recommmend)
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider


"this command to create env for node to run "
now we npm run start client side
enjoy, have fun!!!!!!!
